# DAXPY Kernel x86-64 and C Implementation & Performance Comparison | LBYARCH - S15

DAXPY Function implemented on a C Kernel and x86-64 Assembly Kernel was tested in both Debug Mode and Release Mode across different sizes of input vectors.

The performance of the two kernels was  tested on the DAXPY Function with different vector sizes:

- 2^20 (or 1048576)
- 2^24 (or 16777216)
- 2^2N (TO DO Change N to the highest that it can be tested. Max is 30).
